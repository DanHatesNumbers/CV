\section{Personal Statement}
With a wide range of skills developed through roles in Software Engineering, Quality Engineering and Security Consultancy, I'm a fast learner who can adapt to new environments quickly. I help run the Security Champions program at Capital One and mentor for a Graduate engineer, which is something I find incredibly rewarding.  I'm looking for a role where I can have a real, meaningful impact on the security posture of my company and help protect customers and their data.

\section{Work Experience}

\begin{longtable}{r|p{16cm}}

August 2018 & \textbf{Information Security Consultant} at Capital One, Nottingham \\
to & \\
Current & My current role involves advising feature teams on secure development practises, participating in Threat Models, reviewing infrastructure designs for systems being deployed to both our AWS and on-premesis environments and writing self-service guidance and advice. The teams I consult for work on a range of different products and across a wide variety of technologies, which requires me  to effectively juggle competing priorities and cope with frequent context switching. I am also involved in managing our Security Champions program, organising sessions, booking speakers and producing short quizes to measure attendee engagement with the training content on the course.\\

November 2016 & \textbf{Quality Engineer} at Capital One, Nottingham \\
to & \\
August 2018 & As a Quality Engineer at Capital One, I helped deliver a project to bring our online account servicing platform in-house. As part of this project I took part in story refinement, defined the approach to testing used by my team, developed automated functional tests and shared this knowledge with the rest of my team to help the team before more cross-functional.This role also gave me the opportunity to try mentoring a graduate, which is something I found very fulfilling and I continue to mentor this person despite moving roles internally. While in this role, Capital One launched it's first iteration of a Security Champions program, which allowed me to start introducing Security to my role. I presented a walkthrough of a Boot2Root VM I had recently completed to this forum, which was well received and inspired another member of the community to investigate Java Deserialisation vulnerabilities and present on the topic.\\

May 2014 & \textbf{Graduate Software Engineer} at Gala Coral Group, Nottingham \\
to & \\
November 2016 & My role at Gala provided me with an excellent opportunity to work with the Xamarin cross-platform C\# mobile app development framework, building new functionality and resolving technical debt in a suite of line of business iOS apps. I was responsible for moving to a virtualised OS X build infrastructure, using a Mac Mini running VMWare ESXi to provide each developer on the team with their own build host. I have also implemented Continuous Integration builds for a number of existing projects (including mobile apps, web apps and a WPF app) using TeamCity. As part of
this process of setting up Continuous Integration, I developed a tool that leverages the Swagger API documentation project and the AutoRest program from the Azure team to generate, build and package Portable Class Library compatible API clients from a JSON representation of the API. \\

June 2012 & \textbf{Software Engineer Industrial Placement} at ARM, Cambridge \\
to & \\
August 2013 & While working at ARM, I was part of a team of engineers embedded in the Marketing Communications department. The majority of my time was spent building technical demonstrations of ARM technologies to showcase a set of marketing requirements. I also staffed demo booths at events that ARM attended, explaining to partners and members of the public what the demonstrations were doing, how they were built and answering any questions they may have. \\
